  MyAppState defines the data the app needs to function. Right now, it only
  contains single variable.

  MyAppState extends ChangeNotifier, this means MyAppState can notify others
  about the data change.

  The state is created and provided to the whole app using a Class
  ChangeNotifierProvider

            |MyApp| -----> MyAppState
            -------             ^

/*
  1) Every widget defines a build method that's automatically called everytime
  when the widget's circumstances like state changes. so that the widget is
  always upto date.
  2) MyHomePage tracks the app state using the watch method
  3) Every build method must return a widget or (more typically) a nested tree
  of widgets. In this case, the top-level widget is Scaffold
  4) Column is one of the most basic layout widget in flutter. It takes any
  number of children and puts them in a column from top to bottom
  5) Here Column layout widget contains three child widgets, in which second
  text widget takes appState and access the current state of the app.
