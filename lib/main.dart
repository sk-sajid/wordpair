  MyAppState defines the data the app needs to function. Right now, it only
  contains single variable.

  MyAppState extends ChangeNotifier, this means MyAppState can notify others
  about the data change.

  The state is created and provided to the whole app using a Class
  ChangeNotifierProvider

  1) Every widget defines a build method that's automatically called everytime
  when the widget's circumstances like state changes. so that the widget is
  always upto date.
  2) MyHomePage tracks the app state using the watch method
  3) Every build method must return a widget or (more typically) a nested tree
  of widgets. In this case, the top-level widget is Scaffold
  4) Column is one of the most basic layout widget in flutter. It takes any
  number of children and puts them in a column from top to bottom
  5) Here Column layout widget contains three child widgets, in which second
  text widget takes appState and access the current state of the app.

      Flutter uses Composition over Inheritance whenever it can.
      Here, instead of padding being an attribute of Text, it's a widget!

      This way, widgets can focus on their single responsibility, and you,
      the developer, have total freedom in how to compose your UI.
      For example, you can use the Padding widget to pad text, images, buttons,
      your own custom widgets, or the whole app.
      The widget doesn't care what it's wrapping.

      Dart, the programming language in which you're writing this app,
      is null-safe, so it won't let you call methods of objects that are
      potentially null. In this case, though, you can use the ! operator
      to assure Dart you know what you're doing. (displayMedium is definitely
      not null in this case)

      Calling copyWith() on displayMedium returns a copy of the text style
      with the changes you define. In this case, you're only changing
      the text's color.
